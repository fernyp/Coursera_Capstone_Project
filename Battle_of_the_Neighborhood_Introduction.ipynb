From long time companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard, social media giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter to a plethora of startups - the Silicon Valley attracts high-skilled workers from all over the world.\n\nWhen there is an influx of workforce into a region, the cost of living begins to increase. The Silicon Valley is currently going through a 'housing crisis' - with housing prices skyrocketing, affordability is a major issue. For someone moving to the Silicon Valley for a new job, buying a home might far from reach. The other option is finding a place to rent.",
